        <h2>Welcome to BODC-DEI</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the website of the Boston Open Data Collaborative for Diversity Equity and Inclusion (BODC-DEI). We are a group of tech enthusiasts, data analysts, UX designers, quality assurance professionals, and Linux systems administrators who are passionate about using open data to create tools that serve the public in a fair and responsible way.</p>
        <p>Our group was founded with the vision of collaborating on projects based on the <a href="https://data.boston.gov/">250 datasets available on data.boston.gov</a>. We aim to create individual projects and showcase them as part of a collaborative group. We believe that by combining our diverse skills and fresh perspectives, we can create tools that are useful to everyone in the community.</p>
        <p>At BODC-DEI, we strongly believe in the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We recognize the importance of considering these factors when dealing with public data about the public. We are committed to creating tools that serve everyone and present data in a fair and responsible way.</p>
        <p>We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our ongoing projects and initiatives. We also encourage you to get involved and join our group of collaborators.

        <h2>Coming Soon: Boston 311 Project</h2>
        <p>The Boston 311 project is a machine learning project focused on the 311 service requests dataset, which is available on data.boston.gov. The project aims to develop a tool that can predict the likelihood of a 311 service request being resolved within a certain timeframe, based on various factors such as the type of request, the location of the request, and the time of day.</p>

        <p>By analyzing the data from the 311 service requests, the project team hopes to gain insights into the patterns and trends of service requests in the city of Boston. The ultimate goal is to develop a tool that can assist city officials in allocating resources and prioritizing service requests more effectively.</p>
          
        <p>The team is using Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory to analyze the data and develop predictive models, and they are planning to build a web application to showcase their findings.</p>

        <h2>Coming Soon: Boston Crime Map Project</h2>
        <p>The proposed project is an interactive crime map that utilizes Boston Police Log data and is built using JavaScript. The main objective of the project is to create an engaging and informative tool that allows users to easily navigate crime data in the city of Boston.

        <p>To ensure that the project adheres to principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), the data will be properly contextualized. This means that the map will display crime data in a way that avoids perpetuating stereotypes or biases that may exist in the original data. Additionally, the map will provide context for the crime data, such as socio-economic factors, that may contribute to crime in different areas of the city.</p>
          
        <p>The project will be developed using modern web development techniques and will be optimized for performance and accessibility. The map will be interactive, allowing users to filter and sort the data based on a variety of criteria, such as crime type and location. The map will also provide a timeline of the crime data, allowing users to see how crime has changed over time in different areas of the city.</p>
          
        <p>Overall, the goal of this project is to create a tool that provides useful and informative crime data in a way that is accessible and equitable for all users. By utilizing principles of DEI, the project will ensure that the data is presented in a way that avoids perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases.</p>
